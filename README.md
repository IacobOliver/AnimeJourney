## Setup 

 ### Backend Setup

1. Prerequisites:
 - Ensure you have the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
 - If needed, reload Maven dependencies by right-clicking the pom.xml file and selecting "Maven -> Reload Project."
 - have PostreSQL installed and make a db for this project to store the data

2. Run the server :
   - start the backend server by runnning the AnimeJourney class
  

### Frontend Setup

1. Prerequisites:
- Make sure Node.js is installed and properly configured on your system.

2. Install the dependecies
- Navigate to the Frontend directory in your terminal with ``` cd ./frontend```
- - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
      ```
      npm install
      ```
      (Alternatively, you can use `pnpm install`.)
    
3. Populate the database on local db (OPTIONAL)
IMPORTANT !!! -> If the site won't load if you did everything right, it's very possible for the SupabaseDB to be down due to inactivity, mail me at olialexander08@gmail.com and I will get it back up again!
- For a beeter performance you can save the animes on your local db, you need to have postgreSQL installed and create a db in pgAdmin, then in the project in backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
- you need to modify this with your info
   ```
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/  YOUR DATABASE NAME
    spring.datasource.username= YOUR USERNAME
    spring.datasource.password=  YOUR PASSWORD
   ```
- Navigate to the populate folder in frontend with ``` cd./frontend/populate```
- here you need to run the command ```node populateNewAnimeSeasons``` and when it says "POPULATE DONE" and  run ```node populateTopAnime``` and wait for it to show the same message
- you are now setup, navigate back in the frontend folder with ```cd ..``` and run ``` npm run dev``` then ```Ctrl + Click``` on the first link
- make sure you have both the frontend and the backend :)
