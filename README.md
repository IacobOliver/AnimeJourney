# AnimeJourney
## Project Descriptoin
 It's a solo project, where you an track you favorite animes, newest anime and upcoming anime. If you make an account you will be able to make your own anime list by marking them as watching, on-hold, drop and plan to watch, you can give it a score from 1-10 and leave a review if you want. It's not a streaming application, but maybe in the future will be, this project is still work in progress.

 ## Tehnologies Used : 
 
 - Spring: Accelerated Java application development, creating necessary APIs and database repositories.
 - PostgreSQL : A local relational database for storing the anime and the users and thier anime lists
 - React :  A popular web application library known for its effectiveness in creating interactive and dynamic UI components.
 - Tailwind: Used for impressive and responsive styling, in addition to custom CSS.
 - CSS: Additional custom styling.

## Challenges

- For now, the biggest challenge is to make the page look more and more professional and to decide how the page will look on different sizes
- One more challenge that i think i will have when implementing users it's to save their anime list, because i want to make it efficient. Currently I am using jikan api, and i saved some data form the api in my db, the biggest flaw of this api is that it has a limit of 3 requests per second, so i need to think twice as much about what i save and how i save in my db.

## Future Plans

- for now, finishing the detailed page of an anime

- implementing users with spring security
- making the search page and adding filters for searching the anime
- maybe if i have the resouces to stream some anime on it
- maybe some premium options that you will ne to pay for
